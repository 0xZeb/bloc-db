> 1.Choose 3 questions from the list of sample interview questions above and record yourself answering them using an unlisted Youtube channel. Submit the link with this checkpoint to get feedback on your responses.

* Why do you want to work for this company?
Company general reputation

I have been a big fan of this company for as long as I can remember. Working at a company with this kind of track record offers the challenges and rewards that get you excited to show up to work everyday. This sounds like a great fit for someone like me.

* Tell me about one of your accomplishments.
One of the accomplishments I am most proud of was achieving my goal of earning a
Division 1 football scholarship. It will always remind me of how hard you have work to overcome setbacks and to continue to grow individually. It was the most challenging
thing I have done, but it was also the most rewarding.

* What unique qualities do you bring to this team?
Being on so many successful teams in the past has shown me that flexibility is a vital, but over looked skill. I'm willing to work with anyone on any task to make sure we are successful.
